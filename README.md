<h3 align="center">🏆 Third Place Winner </h3>

Writeups of the BSides Augusta CTF in partnership with HackTheBox (HTB) that took place October 7th, 2023 at the [BSides Augusta 10th Annual Conference](https://bsidesaugusta.org/).

> I tried not to use downloadable software or a virtual machine during this CTF so some of the tools that I directly mentioned that I used are pretty abnormal. But, I couldn’t run a VM on my laptop, didn’t wanna install a bunch of stuff w/ low memory, and thought it was a fun showcase that you do not need a full Kali or Arch set-up. (I didn’t even have python installed 💀)
